# Embedded Virtual Machine Demo Application

This repository contains the definition for the Embedded VM demo application. This program interacts with a time-of-flight sensor and an OLED display. It currently runs on an nRF52840 Development Kit and a host machine using an Aardvark adapter.

# About the Project

The `embvm-project` project defines a basic application that reads from a time-of-flight sensor and outputs the data to the display. We demonstrate how an application can run on any platform which satisfies its requirements by providing examples that run on:

- An nRF52840 Development Kit
- A simulator platform running on your personal computer and using an Aardvark I2C/SPI adapter with the associated hardware.

To demonstrate the separateness of the application and platform layers, this project only contains application source code. The platforms that it runs on are made available through an external dependency: [`embvm/embvm-demo-platforms`](https://github.com/embvm/embvm-demo-platforms).

# Project Status

This project has reached v1.0. At this time, only build system improvements are planned.

## Getting Started

If you are unfamiliar with the Embedded VM project, please see the [`embvm-core`](https://github.com/embvm/embvm-core/) repository for more information and a [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/embvm/embvm-core/tree/master/docs/UsingTheFramework/getting_started.m).

### Requirements

This project uses [Embedded Artistry's standard Meson build system](https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldatlas/embedded-artistrys-standardized-meson-build-system/), and dependencies are described in detail [on our website](https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldatlas/embedded-artistrys-standardized-meson-build-system/).

At a minimum you will need:

* [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com), which is used to store binary files in this repository
* [Meson](#meson-build-system) is the build system
* Some kind of compiler for your target system.
    - This repository has been tested with:
        - gcc-7, gcc-8, gcc-9
        - arm-none-eabi-gcc
        - Apple clang
        - Mainline clang

#### git-lfs

This project stores some files using [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com).

To install `git-lfs` on Linux:

```
sudo apt install git-lfs
```

To install `git-lfs` on OS X:

```
brew install git-lfs
```

Additional installation instructions can be found on the [`git-lfs` website](https://git-lfs.github.com).

#### Meson Build System

The [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com) build system depends on `python3` and `ninja-build`.

To install on Linux:

```
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip ninja-build
```

To install on OSX:

```
brew install python3 ninja
```

Meson can be installed through `pip3`:

```
pip3 install meson
```

If you want to install Meson globally on Linux, use:

```
sudo -H pip3 install meson
```

### Getting the Source

This project uses [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com), so please install it before cloning. If you cloned prior to installing `git-lfs`, simply run `git lfs pull` after installation.

This project is hosted on GitHub. You can clone the project directly using this command:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/embvm/embvm-core
```

If you don't clone recursively, be sure to run the following command in the repository or your build will fail:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Building

If Make is installed, the project can be built by issuing the following command:

```
make
```

This will build all targets for your current architecture.

You can clean builds using:

```
make clean
```

You can eliminate the generated `buildresults` folder using:

```
make distclean
```

You can also use  `meson` directly for compiling.

Create a build output folder:

```
meson buildresults
```

And build all targets by running

```
ninja -C buildresults
```

Cross-compilation is handled using `meson` cross files. Example files are included in the [`build/cross`](build/cross/) folder. You can write your own cross files for your specific processor by defining the toolchain, compilation flags, and linker flags. These settings will be used to compile the project.

Cross-compilation must be configured using the meson command when creating the build output folder. For files stored within `build/cross`, we provide a Makefile `CROSS` to simplify the process. This variable will automatically supply the proper Meson argument, `build/cross/` prefix, and `.txt` filename extension.

You can use a single file, or you can layer multiple files by separating the names with a colon.

```
make CROSS=arm:cortex-m4_hardfloat
```

You can also do this manually with the Meson interface. Note, however, that you will need to include a special `--cross-file=build/cross/embvm.txt` cross file to ensure that the required Embedded VM settings are applied.

```
meson buildresults --cross-file build/cross/arm.txt --cross-file build/cross/cortex-m4_hardfloat.txt --cross-file=build/cross/embvm.txt
```

Following that, you can run `make` (at the project root) or `ninja -C buildresults` to build the project.

> **Note:** Tests will not be cross-compiled. They will only be built for the native platform.

**Full instructions for working with the build system, including topics like using alternate toolchains and running supporting tooling, are documented in [Embedded Artistry's Standardized Meson Build System](https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldatlas/embedded-artistrys-standardized-meson-build-system/) on our website.**

## Configuration Options

Build configuration is covered in depth in the [Configuration and Tuning](https://github.com/embvm/embvm-core/tree/master/docs/UsingTheFramework/configuration_and_tuning.md) guide in the [`embvm-core`](https://github.com/embvm/embvm-core) project.

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Documentation

The bulk of the Embedded VM documentation is contained in the [`embvm-core` repository](https://github.com/embvm/embvm-core). This repository only contains documentation relevant to this specific module.

### Building the Documentation

Full documentation can be built locally by running the following command:

```
make docs
```

Documentation can be found in `buildresults/docs`, and the root page is `index.html`.
